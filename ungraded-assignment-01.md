# Ungraded Assignment 1

## Install Ubuntu Onto a Flash Drive
Follow [these instructions](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows) for creating a USB stick on Windows, or [these](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-macos) for Mac. If possible, use a flash drive with an LED so you can see when the drive is being accessed.

## Set User Password
Each of the six Linux/Ubuntu machines in Dana Hall 302 has every enrolled student in this course as a user on the machine. (The username is the student’s first name, all in lowercase.) However, a password has not been assigned. Log into at least three of the six machines as “user” (you already know the password for “user”), then assign a password that only you know to your account. (You may use the same password for all the machines.) When you’re done, logout of the machine, then log back in with your username and your new password.

Do this from the Terminal, *not* through Ubuntu’s GUI. All the commands you need to successfully complete this assignment were discussed during the second week of class. Refer to your notes.
